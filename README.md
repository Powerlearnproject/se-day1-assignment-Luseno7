Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software Engineering is basically the discipline that employs application of Engineering principles, methods and tools to develop high quality software products.
It is important in the technology industry as its helps run/power various crucial aspects of life such as
a.)Healthcare >For example through the various software tools developed we are able to collect and store data that has been useful in helping find out more about various diseases, how to combat them and eventually eradicate them.
b.)Communication -> Through various software tools, communication has never been easier. We are all able to connect with individuals across the world at the click of a button and its all thanks to software engineering through mobile app developments,web applications etc.
c.)Commerce-> Due to the various innovations in software dealing with numbers has been made dramatically easier and not only that, but we are able to apply the data collected over time to figure out different trends that have helped improve how we carry out various business transactions and run the economy better globally.
d.) Entertainment -> All work with no play makes Jack a dull buy. Honestly this is one aspect of sofware development that has shown tremendous growth and brought so much unity globally. Not only has software engineering through various innovations made entertainment easily accessible globally but it has also helped create employment opportunities through the various apps, machines and network software systems developed over the past decades.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a.)AI Powered development -> This has grown over the past decade. Artificial interlligence has made coding way faster, less frustrating and more efficient. Its incorporation in even more day to day activities like content generation, virtual assistants and chatbots is actually all the rage as we speak.
b.)Devops and continuous delivery-> Through this software updates have become faster with automation and continuous intergration. This is as a result of devops which intergrates software development and IT operations to shorten the software development life cycle while maintaining high quality software.The best part is that the updates work seamlessly without crashing and malfunctioning unlike before.
c.)Cloud computing and serveless architecture ->Through cloud apps like azure,google cloud and AWS, applications can run smoothly without the trouble of having to maintain huge physical servers.This is by offering virtual servers,storages,databases, networking, software and analytics.It offers on demand self service, broad network base, resource pooling, rapid elasticity and measured services.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a.)Requirement -> This is collecting and documentation of user needs and system requiremnents.
b.)Design -> The creation of high level designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c.)Implementation -> This is writing of the codes, building of the software according to the design specification given.
d.)Testing -> Trying out the sofware to ensure it meets the quality standard and functional requirements
e.)Deployment ->Releasing the final product/software to the customers/users/clients.
f.) Maintenance -> Provision of ongoing support, updates, imporvements, adjustments after deploying of the software to the users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
*Waterfall methodology is more sequential, sytematic where each step builds on the other unlike agile methodolgy which is more flexible and it builds on the changing requirments in collaboartion with what the client wants. It uses a more iteractive and incremental approach where software is developed in small cycles.
- Waterfall methodology is best applied in cases like banking software development. It is more rigid and extensive with changes to it being a bit difficult. Its best for project with clear and stable requirements.
- Agile methodology is best applied in mobile apps deveolopment which changes based on trends and consumer needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a. )Software developers-Are responsible for writing the codes,implementing the codes and software solutions.They code, design solutions,debug,collaborate with the rest of the team and keep up with software trends.
b.)Quality assurance Engineer ensures quality by designing and executing test plans rigorously so as to catch problems before they reach the users.They do so by unit testing, intergration testing, system testing and acceptance testing.
c.)Project manager oversees the entire procees to completion by planning,coordinationg executing and delivering the software project within the budget and within the allocated timeframe.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
A.)IDEs(Intergrated Development Environments -> It is importance in the following ways 
i) Provides code writing efficiency with features like auto-copletion,error detection and syntax highlighting e.g visual studio,eclipse
ii)Debugging and testing ->helps in fixing errors fast.
iii) Code organization -> heps manage large projects with multiple files  eg jetbrains for jave development with powerful code anylsis
iv)Reduces manual eefort through automation eG XCODE Which helps code faster in developing operating systems in apple ios and macOS

B.)Version control systems tracks changes to source coesa and coordinates work among team members allowing multiple developers to colaborate without overwriting each other's work.Importance:
i)Allows collaboration by many developers all at once/simultaneously. eg Git
ii)History tracking by keeping archives of all changes made.EG. Subversion
iii)Branching and merging different ideas from different developers
iv) Bug tracking using the stored archives through identification and fixing of previous errors previously encountered and buidling on that.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a.)Unit testing -> Asseses the individual component of the software
b.) Intergration-> Asses how the different software systems work together and interact.
c.)System software ->Test the entire system holistically to see that it all meets the specific functionl and quality requirements.
d.) Acceptance testing -> Test the software against user needs/requirements to ensure it meets the clients/users needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is basically coming up with questions/statements that help get the best possible response from AI models.
Importance;
a.) Optimzes AI capabilities by unlocking more advances features like creativity, reasoning and summarizing.
b.) Reduces bias and errors as it prompts the AI to craft better calcuated responses hence minimizing misleading or false output.
c.) Improves efficiency by reducing the need for multiple adjustments/refinement of answers.
d.)Enables customization as the AI is able to repond to more specific tasks.
e.) Enhances accuracy from well structured prompts unlike with vague ones. This leads to more precise answeres to the prompts.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Example -> What is a car, answer-> A car is a 4 wheeled motor vehicle designed for transport powered by an internal combustion engine or electric motor.
Example of Refined question:What cars are more efficient for off road travel? answer Offroad vehicles are designed to handle rough terrains and they typically have a high ground clearance and durable suspension systems to handle the rough terrains for example Jeep wranglers or Toyota Landcruisers.
***The improved prompt is more effective as it helps the AI give more clear, specific and ellaborate responses and helps improve the interaction with the AI tool.This not only helps tailor the AI to have more depth but also helps one get the most out of the AI.
